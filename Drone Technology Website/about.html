      <h1> How will drone technology impact the world</h1>
      <p>We are seeing that drone is being used more in the correct way it should be use or a more effectively than it uses to be and not just by defence organizations and tech expert consumers and big company are use it and private individual are now also seeing the use of it drone. Drone is becoming more of a day to day thing now it will one day take over the humans’ jobs that are highly dangerous jobs and has to look at how to benefit from it. Drone could be a cost effective way for companies to save money and no need for humans’. The market for drones is big and has some big company battling it out to see who the best is. The Military is ahead of everyone on drone tech and is mostly years ahead of other companies. The US has the most money to be able to spend on drone tech and has a defence budget of $640 billion which means there they can make technology that is level high and unheard of. Drone could also help the medical as well by having a thermal drone that can find people that are stuck under rubble and having a medical drone do help natural dieters and get to places that are cut off from an earthquake</p>

          What will drone technology be in the future?
          </h1>
          <p> OTHER than the drones and defence sectors being affected from the covid-19 pandemic in the terms of global slowdown it triggered the global aerospace and the tech company paramount advanced technologies is optimist is about the future. Paramount advanced technologies initial systems were started and deployed over two decade ago and there company offers lot of different type of UAV solutions from small, short- range UAVs to medium-altitude and long-endurance UAV. They have managed to retain its core capability and build on it and innovative solutions during the difficult trading conditions. They say that the market of the drone market is looking promising and they say it will rise and grow by the 2021 to 2025 to a $21.01-billion. They are having big experiencing robust growth in demand for policing applications border management application</p>

      What are the technologies used by drones
      </h1>
      <p>
      drone are known as UAV it's  basically an flying robot that can be controlled remotely or it may have its own technology software that make it fly its self in flight plans which are embedded in to their system. Drone technology is evolving ever year and with the investments inform its increasing year by year. There is a wide range of use that the drone can be used for and there are crucial for several industries for example the military to gathering intelligence etc. the military is not the only field where drone have irreplaceable value from today. They are used in weather and prediction and traffic monitoring in search and rescue effort as well and reach place that human and larger machines cannot reach. They are also used for personal and business purposes like real estate and delivery service too that re among the industries which have a benefited from drone tech.
